        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        " - Memory management in Python refers to the process of managing the allocation, usage, and deallocation of memory in a Python program. Python uses automatic memory management to simplify programming, which means developers don't need to manually allocate or free memory. This is managed by Python’s memory manager and garbage collection system, which ensures that memory is handled efficiently, and objects that are no longer needed are properly cleaned up.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - Python's exception handling mechanism allows you to gracefully handle errors and maintain the normal flow of the program. The basic steps in exception handling are:\n",
        "      - try: Code that might raise an exception.\n",
        "      - except: Code to handle the exception.\n",
        "      - else (optional): Code that runs if no exception occurs.\n",
        "      - finally (optional): Code that runs no matter what, often used for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        " - Memory management in Python is important for several reasons, including:\n",
        "     - Efficient use of system resources\n",
        "     - Avoiding memory leaks and system slowdowns\n",
        "     - Optimizing performance for large-scale applications\n",
        "     - Ensuring scalability and system stability\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "   - The try Block: The try block is used to wrap the code that you suspect might raise an exception. You place the code that could potentially cause an error inside the try block.\n",
        "   - The except Block: The except block is used to catch the exception raised in the try block. Once an exception is raised, Python will check if it matches any of the except blocks specified.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "  - Python's garbage collection (GC) system is responsible for automatically managing memory by identifying and reclaiming memory used by objects that are no longer needed by the program. This helps avoid memory leaks and makes memory management more efficient, reducing the burden on developers.\n",
        "  In Python, garbage collection works based on two key mechanisms:\n",
        "     - Reference Counting\n",
        "     - Generational Garbage Collection (GC)\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - The else block in exception handling is used to specify code that should execute only if no exceptions are raised in the try block. It helps separate normal code from error-handling code, improving readability and structure. It avoids unnecessary nesting and keeps the code clean and efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "   - The common logging levels in Python:\n",
        "      - Critical\n",
        "      - Error\n",
        "      - Warning\n",
        "      - Info\n",
        "      - Debug\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "  - Closing a file in Python is essential for:\n",
        "     - Proper resource management (like file descriptors).\n",
        "     - Ensuring that all data is written to the file (by flushing the buffer\n",
        "     - Preventing memory leaks and releasing system resources.\n",
        "     - Avoiding file locking issues.\n",
        "   \n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "   - The logging module in Python is used to add logging functionality to your programs. Logging allows you to record messages that describe the behavior of the application, such as errors, warnings, informational messages, or debugging details. It is an essential tool for tracking application behavior and troubleshooting issues, particularly in production environments where debugging and print statements are not practical."

        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        " - Compiled languages: Translate the entire program into machine code before execution, resulting in faster performance but platform-specific executables.\n",
        " - Interpreted languages: Translate and execute the code line by line at runtime, providing more flexibility and ease of debugging but at the cost of slower execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - Exception handling allows you to make your Python programs more robust by managing unexpected errors and ensuring they don’t lead to program crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - The finally block runs no matter what, even if an exception was raised and handled or if no exception occurred. It is generally used for cleanup operations, such as closing files, releasing resources, or performing any final operations that should always happen. It's an essential tool for writing robust, error-free code when managing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        " - Logging in Python is a powerful and flexible system for tracking events in your program. The logging module provides various log levels, handlers, and formatters to control where and how messages are logged. It’s a more sophisticated and manageable way to handle program output compared to simple print statements, especially for debugging, monitoring, and maintaining large applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The __del__ method is a destructor in Python, used to define cleanup actions when an object is about to be destroyed.It’s primarily used for resource management, ensuring things like file handles or network connections are closed when an object is deleted. The exact time of invocation is controlled by Python's garbage collection, which is not deterministic. Care should be taken when using __del__ with circular references, and exceptions in __del__ should be avoided or handled properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        " - import module - when you need to access many functions or classes from a module and want to keep the namespace clear.\n",
        " - from module - when you only need a specific function, class, or variable from a module and want to use it directly without the module prefix.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        " - You can handle multiple exceptions by either using multiple except blocks or grouping them in one block using a tuple.\n",
        " - The else block executes when no exceptions are raised, while the finally block runs regardless of exceptions.\n",
        " - Raising custom exceptions with raise can help you enforce specific conditions in your program.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        " - The with statement provides a cleaner, more efficient, and error-resistant way to handle files in Python by ensuring that the file is automatically closed, even if an exception is raised during file operations. This makes the code more readable and less prone to errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        " - Multithreading involves running multiple threads within the same process. A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a program. In multithreading, several threads share the same memory space and resources of the process. They can run concurrently, but they still execute in the context of the same process.\n",
        " - Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes, each with its own memory space and resources. Each process runs independently and is typically executed on a separate CPU core.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        " - Enhanced Debugging: Makes it easier to troubleshoot issues.\n",
        " - Monitoring: Provides insights into application behavior.\n",
        " - Flexible Configuration: Offers multiple logging destinations and formats.\n",
        " - Non-Blocking: Can be configured to run asynchronously.\n",
